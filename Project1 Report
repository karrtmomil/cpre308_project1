Karl Akert Project 1 Section D

	This project taught me a lot about how processes function and interface between the user and the system.  I now have a much greater understanding on how forks are usefull by having implemented them to spawn child processes to follow new commands.  I also have a better understanding about how to have the parent process wait for input.  There are many different ways for programs to communicate with eachother.  There are functions like waitpid(), the return of the function itself, and then statuses posted to the errno constant.

	I also have gained a greater understanding of how to use threads effectively.  For background processes I created a thread that would consistently check for the child's termination without being dependant on user input.  I also have an even greater appreciaction for how powerful bash is, but am quite impressed that a simple shell like this was so straightforward.
